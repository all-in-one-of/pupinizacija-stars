00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,100
inventions are the handwork of mortal man,
though at first they appeal to us as something


2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,545
normal, we ought to look at them
as wonderful creations of human ingenuity.


3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:20,600
their ultimate fate is to become more or
less commonplace. The telegraph, and the


4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,700
telephone, the dynamo and the motor,
the light of the electrical arc


5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,400
and of the incandescent filament,
had lost much of their awe - inspiring


6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,400
character even at the time when I was
a student at Cambridge. Inventions grow old


7
00:00:26,478 --> 00:00:40,400
and are superseded by other inventions, and,
being the creation of the constructive schemes


8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:48,200
of mortal man, are themselves mortal. But
the laws which the stars and the planets obey


9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,600
and have always obeyed in their paths
through the heavens are unchangeable;


10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,600
they never grow old, and therefore
they are immortal; they are a part of the


11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:06,500
the eternal truth. We do not know of any
natural processes by which eternal things


12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,600
have been evolved. Their existence is the
best philosophic proof that back of all this


13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,700
changeable visible world there is
the unchangeable, the eternal divinity.
