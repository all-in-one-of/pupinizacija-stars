00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,183
Inventions are the handwork of mortal man.


2
00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:12,931
Though at first they appeal to us as something normal
we ought to look at them as wonderful creations of human ingenuity.


3
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:19,587
Their ultimate fate is to become more or less commonplace.


4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The telegraph, and telephone, dynamo and motor,
the light of the electrical arc and of the incandescent filament,


5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,394
had lost much of their awe - inspiring character
even at the time when I was a student at Cambridge.


6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:44,045
Inventions age and are superseded by other inventions and
being the creation of the constructive schemes of a mortal man, are themselves mortal.


7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,000
But the laws which the stars and the planets obey and have always obeyed
in their paths through the heavens are unchangeable;


8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:01:01,286
They never age, and therefore they are immortal;
they are a part of the the eternal truth.


9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,600
We do not know of any natural processes by which eternal things have been evolved.


10
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,000
Their existence is the best philosophic proof that back of all this changeable visible world


11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,704
there is the unchangeable, the eternal divinity.
